[Key Changes From v0.9.7 To v1.0.0]

- Property setter scripts are no longer required.

- TweenSimple*() scripts have been changed to TweenEasy*() variants and now support an optional [mode] argument.

- TweenFire, TweenCreate, TweenPlay have all been overhauled and are NOT backwards compatible.
  * They now support multiple properties in a single tween
  * TweenFire has To/From variants which make use of new property getters
  * They now support "x"/"y"/"etc" stringed properties instead of x__/y__ script names.
	Example:
		TweenFire(id, EaseLinear, 0, true, 0, 1, "x", x, mouse_x, "y", y, mouse_y);
	
		// You can use up to 10 properties with a single tween call
		TweenFireTo(id, EaseLinear, 0, true, 0, 1,
							  "x", mouse_x,
						          "y", mouse_y,
							  "image_angle", 360,
							  "image_scale", 2.0)

		
- TweenSet() and TweenGet() have replaced the various TweenGet*() and TweenSet*() scripts.
  * They now receive string labels for modifying the appropriate tween setting.
  * Please open and read the respective TweenGet() and TweenSet() scripts to find all supported string labels.
	e.g.
		TweenSet(tween, "time_scale", 0.5);
		TweenSet(tween, "duration", 3.0);
		destination = TweenGet(tween, "destination");

- Tweens(), TweensAll(), TweensGroup, and TweensTarget() have replaced the *All, *Group, *Target script variants.
  * Any script with the tween[s] argument supports them
	e.g.
		TweenPause(TweensAll());
		TweenDestroy(TweensGroup(5));
		TweenResume(TweensTarget(id));
		TweenReverse(TweensTarget(obj_Player));

  	* TweensAll() has a shorthand version using the keyword [all]
	e.g.
		TweenResume(all);

- User Events can now be used as property setters/getters using the TPUser() property script
  with TWEEN_USER_TARGET and TWEEN_USER_VALUE macros. 
	e.g.
		// Some Event
		TweenFire(id, EaseLinear, 0, false, 0, 1, TPUser(0), 0, 100);

		// User Event 0
		TWEEN_USER_TARGET.someVariable = TWEEN_USER_VALUE;
  
  * Here is a quick example showing how to set up a getter/setter version to support TweenFireTo/From()
	e.g.
		// User Event 0
		if (TWEEN_USER_GET)
		{   // Getter
		    TWEEN_USER_GET = TWEEN_USER_TARGET.someVariable;
		}
		else
		{   // Setter
		    TWEEN_USER_TARGET.coolVariable = TWEEN_USER_VALUE;
		}
